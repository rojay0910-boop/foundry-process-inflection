This project uses a foundry-level process timeline as its primary analytical lens to examine how advanced semiconductor manufacturing has evolved since the transition to FinFET.
Rather than comparing nodes by nominal process size or vendor performance claims, the analysis focuses on structural technology decisions, 
including transistor architecture and system-level manufacturing choices, across Intel, TSMC, and Samsung.

By fixing each company on a consistent timeline and plotting key process milestones by year, the visualization reveals an important pattern: 
after the industry-wide shift from planar transistors to FinFET around 2012–2014, transistor architecture remained largely unchanged for nearly a decade, even as nodes scaled from 7nm to 3nm.
This extended architectural stability does not indicate stagnation, but rather a strategic phase in which progress was driven by increasingly complex process optimization—such as lithography scaling, materials engineering, and product-specific tuning—within a stable FinFET framework.

True generational transitions emerge only when existing architectures can no longer be extended. The introduction of Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors,
followed by backside power delivery, represents such inflection points.
Viewed through this timeline-driven framework, advanced-node evolution is reframed as a sequence of engineering trade-offs under physical, 
economic, and manufacturability constraints, rather than a simple race defined by node numbers.
